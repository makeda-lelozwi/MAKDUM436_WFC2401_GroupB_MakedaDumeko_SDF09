# Learning Reflections README 

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
For the SDF09 submission we were tasked with using the Tailwind CSS framework to style a footer for a CodeSpace web-page. 

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **inputing classes**: I was quite efficient at knowing how to input new classes or change classses within html elements.  


#### Challenges Faced
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: Everytime I hovered over a post, it would show the next post and make it too big. But I go tsome help from a classmate and fixed the problem. 

- **Styling Elements**: I had trouble with making the instagram profile look close to the real Instagram because the page doesn't have many colours or visible borders that I could use to gauge how big things should be. Again, my classmates came to the rescue. 

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I need more practice with using flexbox and understanding how the display property works.
- **Creative Design Choices**: I think with more time I will be confident to add my own stylistic choices to my projects. 

#### Overall Learning Experience
 This project was very eye-opening in how creative the developers who create the websites we use everyday are. Not only creative, but I'm sure they understand very well how the computer "thinks" so that they can feed it the right information to get the desired outcome. This realisation made me even more motivated to learn software development and become a good developer. And I also learned how valuable teamwork and collaboration is. That is a continuous lesson that I have learned in the first month of this program.
