## *[SDF09] Project Tailwind Footer***

### Overview
For the SDF09 submission we were tasked with using the Tailwind CSS framework to style a footer for a CodeSpace web-page. 

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **inputing classes**: I was quite efficient at knowing how to input new classes or change classses within html elements.  


#### Challenges Faced
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: I'm still not sure how to implement hover and focus effects without breaking my code. 


#### Areas for Improvement

- **Spacing out elements**: I need more practice with knowing which classes to use and which values to use to space out elements nicely. 
- **Creative Design Choices**: I want to get better at making the elements more responsive

#### Overall Learning Experience
 I was really nervous to start this project because the name just sounds intimidating: CSS Tailwind. However, once I started to watch the YouTube videos and do the SDF09 project itself I started to understand how to use Tailwind. The step-by-step instructions in the LMS were a HUGE help because even though I watched some videos, I still didn't know exactly how to start. The starter-code also was a massive help as well. I am interested in seeing and using more CSS frameworks over time.
